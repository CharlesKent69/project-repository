        <h2>What are Orangutans?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Orangutans are the largest arboreal mammals that spend the majority of their time in trees. They are distinguished 
    by their distinctive red fur. They can move through the branches thanks to their long, powerful arms
    and grasping hands and feet.</p>
        
    <p> Orangutans are omnivores, meaning that they eat both vegetables and meat. An Orangutan's diet consist of fruits
    insects, termites, lizards, honey, nuts, and only rarely eat meat. </p>

    <p>Orangutans are highly intelligent mammals that make tools to do various tasks. but orangutan intelligence goes 
    far beyond making simple tools, research in controlled environments has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being
    one of the few species to recognize their own reflections. </p>

    <p>They also display remarkable foresight, planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught an
    orangutan to use a straw to extract his favourite fruit soup from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
    between a straw or grape that could be eaten right away, and he chose a straw just in case he was given another box
    of soup.</p>
    <p>In another experiment, orangutans figured out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes by 
    spitting water into them.

        <h2>Orangutan population is decreasing</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Indonesia has the world's highest rate of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest are burned annually
    to support the logging and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000 orangutans remaining in the wild
    to poachers. They kill the mothers so that the baby orangutans can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
    doesnt end here. Orphans can be confiscated and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover from
    emotional trauma and continue to develop essential life skills.
    </p>

    <p>Against all odds, these orphans demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn.</p>
