            </header>
            <p>There are many threats to the remaining wild populations of orangutans. The main threats in today to
                the survival of orangutans are,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of habitat through deforestation</li>
                <li>Palm oil plantations</li>
                <li>Illegal hunting</li>
                <li>Illegal Pet Trade</li>
                <li>Illegal logging</li>
                <li>forest and peat fires</li>
                <li>For the benefit of oil palm plantations</li>

               <h2>What causes the decline of orangutan numbers?</h2> 
            </header>
            <p>Quite simply, it's human activity. The boom in palm oil harvesting means
            their rainforest homes are being cut down and replaced with monoculture palm plantations. Other industries such as mining, logging, and small-scale logging also damage  rainforest habitat. As in the United States, when ranchers and wolves have conflicts, farmers often kill orangutans if they get too close to their crops. Unfortunately,
             this happens when orangutans cannot find the food they need in the forest and invade inhabited areas.</p>

        
            <p>Here's what you can do to help:</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the word, tell others that. Buying products that come from palm trees may
            cause orangutans to lose they're homes, the orangutans need you.
            </li>

            <li>Stop buying products made with unsustainable palm oil. Choose products made from deforestation-free palm oil,
             and put pressure on companies that arenâ€™t responsibly sourcing their materials.</li>
            
            <li>Practice recycling. Recycle, drive less, purchase products
            with less packaging, and throw away less waste in general. These little things help reduce the world's load of
            limited resources.</li> 

            <li>Donate to Orangutan Conservation Programs. Donating to these orangutan charities will
            help them continue they're work of protecting these orangutans
